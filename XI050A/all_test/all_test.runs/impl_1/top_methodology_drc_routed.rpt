TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock hdmi_colorbar_top_m0/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin hdmi_colorbar_top_m0/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock tf_pll_m0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin tf_pll_m0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net i_clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): cnt_reg[0]/C, cnt_reg[10]/C, cnt_reg[11]/C, cnt_reg[12]/C, cnt_reg[13]/C,
cnt_reg[14]/C, cnt_reg[15]/C, cnt_reg[16]/C, cnt_reg[17]/C, cnt_reg[18]/C,
cnt_reg[19]/C, cnt_reg[1]/C, cnt_reg[20]/C, cnt_reg[22]/C, cnt_reg[24]/C
 (the first 15 of 28 listed)
Related violations: <none>
